# SillyGamePrototype

Just getting my feet wet with Godot 4 and GDScript, messing around with simple AI and attacks. ðŸ˜…

## Whatâ€™s in here

- A slime that **sees you**, **chases you**, and **kick your ass** maybe.
- Player that can **run, jump, and get smacked around**.  
- Camera that tries to be smartâ€¦ or at least I'm trying.
